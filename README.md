# fnv-nates-new-vegas
A repository for storing my fallout new vegas mod esp.


This mod just works by simply adding features that i think new vegas did not have and should have had or i wanted to personally add.
This mod does require [xNVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883?tab=files) as i do use a lot of their scripting functions.
I do not intend on hosting this on mod hosting sites such as Nexus Mods nor will it have an official release, since this is simply a fun project to work on in my spare time. I intend to update this readme every so often listing what is in the mod.


For now I've added:
a few perks both as jokes and some helpful ones
3 jumpsuit armours which i think are semi broken because of something i forgot to fix in the model
Scripting changes, the game shows messages differently for the dlcs, and also added script handling for custom perks and my mod install bonus
The cap gives you a perk every level and you are now also capped to level 250.
A handful of challenges to make the game more fun!
