# fnv-nates-new-vegas
A repository for storing my fallout new vegas mod esp.


This mod just works by simply adding features that i think new vegas did not have and should have had or i wanted to personally add.
This mod does require [xNVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883?tab=files) as i do use a lot of their scripting functions.
I do not intend on hosting this on mod hosting sites such as Nexus Mods nor will it have an official release, since this is simply a fun project to work on in my spare time. I intend to update this readme every so often listing what is in the mod.
